			<h1>About Me</h1>

			<img src="Assets/images/profile.JPG" class="auth-image" alt="headshot">
			<p>Hi, my name is Valentin Wong and it is my pleasure to meet you! Here's a quick background about me- I love travelling, hiking, nature, and sports. More often than not, you can catch me at a golf course somewhere during the weekends. I was born in Paris and lived in France for 9 years. However, I've nearly forgot all my French-speaking abilities.</p>
			<p>
			I'm currently learning the skills to be a full-stack developer with the help of UC Berkeley Coding Bootcamp. I decided to take on this challenge because I want to expand my skillset and change my career path. I'm very happy to be a part of such a great program because of all the wonderful people who have embarked on the same journey as me!
